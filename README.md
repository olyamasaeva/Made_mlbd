# Title: Machine Learning in Big Data - Linear Regression in Scala with Breeze

## Project Overview:
In this laboratory work, I explore the implementation of Linear Regression, one of the fundamental machine learning algorithms, specifically tailored for big data analysis. By utilizing Scala and the Breeze library, I demonstrate how to efficiently perform linear regression on large datasets with ease.

## Repository Contents:
The repository includes the following components:
 - src/: This folder contains the Scala source code for the Linear Regression implementation using Breeze. The code is well-commented and structured for clarity.
 - data/: Within this directory, you'll find sample datasets used for training and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are available in this folder, providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the Linear Regression implementation and analysis of results.
 - configs/: There are config for usage of this code included
 - build.sbt: build file for this code
   
## Getting Started:
 - Navigate to the src/ folder to access the Scala code for Linear Regression using Breeze.
 - Review the code, and explore the comments to understand the implementation details.
 - For using this code the path to the config as an argument
- Using Your Data:If you wish to apply Linear Regression to your own datasets, place your data files in the data/ folder and put the path to them to config.

I hope this repository enables you to implement Linear Regression in Scala using Breeze effectively for big data analysis. By providing well-documented code, I aim to facilitate your learning journey in Machine Learning in Big Data. Happy coding and exploring the world of Linear Regression with Breeze! ðŸš€
