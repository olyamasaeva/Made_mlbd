# Title: Machine Learning in Big Data - Spark ML Python Linear Classifier with Text Features

## Project Overview:
In this laboratory work, I focused on t Spark ML, a versatile machine learning library designed for big data processing. I implement a Linear Classifier using Python, incorporating three vital text feature extraction techniques: HashingTF for vectorization & IDF for term weighting, and Word2Vec for word embedding.

## Repository Contents:
The repository includes the following components:
 - data/: now empty, should contain train and test data
 - notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are available in this folder, guiding you through each step of the Linear Classifier implementation and analysis.
 - hm04.pdf: Document with laboratory work task content
   
## Getting Started:
- Download to the folder data/ data from this kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data
- Check out the notebooks/ folder to access interactive Jupyter notebooks, providing step-by-step guidance on implementing the Linear Classifier.
 - Follow along with the notebooks to gain in-depth insights into text feature extraction and the classification process.

I hope this repository empowers you to build powerful Spark ML Python Linear Classifiers with advanced text features like HashingTF, IDF, and Word2Vec in big data environments. By providing well-documented code and interactive notebooks, I aim to facilitate your learning journey in Machine Learning for Big Data. Happy coding and exploring the world of Spark ML and Text Classification! ðŸš€
