# Title: Machine Learning in Big Data in MADE - Laboratory Works Repository, first homework branch

## Folders:

 - docker: The "docker" folder contains the necessary Docker configuration and setup to create a Docker container for running big data tools and frameworks. Docker provides a portable and scalable environment, making it convenient for deploying big data processing solutions.

 - map-reduce: The "map-reduce" folder houses MapReduce scripts for calculating the mean and standard deviation of large datasets. MapReduce is a powerful programming model for distributed data processing, allowing us to harness the potential of big data clusters efficiently.

## Folder Structure:

- docker/

     - docker-hadoop: folder with all of multi-container applications using Docker
     - screenshots: folder with screenshots 
     - testfile.txt: testing file to test moving file into hdfs
- map-reduce/
    -scripts: folder for scripts of classic calculation mean and std and map-reduce scripts of calculation mean and std
    - data/: Sample datasets and data files for testing the map-reduce.
    - requerements.txt: file with used libraries
    - results.txt: result of calculation of meand and std by numpy and by map-reduce techique
  
## Getting Started:
 - Navigate to the "docker" folder to build and run the Docker container for big data processing.
 - Explore the "map-reduce" folder to understand and run the MapReduce scripts for calculating mean and standard deviation.

We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for your machine learning journey in the realm of big data analytics. Happy learning and exploring the exciting world of machine learning in big data! ðŸš€
